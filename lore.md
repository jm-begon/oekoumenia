## The Rampart era
The Rampart era starts in 1164 CC (Centurian Calendar) after the Heptarmies war, when the armies of demons, undead and other monstruosities have been defeated. 

The Hepta war corresponds to the appearance of 7 generals from the whole of Septentrionia, who banded their unatural armies together to conquer the whole continent. Only through some heroic deeds, allowing to bend together the nations and independent powers of Septentriona, were the people able to repel the invaders. This unprecedented alliance is referred to as the Rampart.

Of the Heptarmies, remnants have scattered and gone into hiding throughout the Septentrionia. So long it remains that way, there is little threat, but should someone be able to reunite them...


### Geography: generalities
Oekumenia is divided into two main continents: Septentrionia and Meridionia. The Mitoyan Sea runs between them. To the East is the Naval Levan Empire, established through a series of Islands.

- **Septentrionia**:
	- **Boreas**: (FR: Borée): the North country (french-inspired), ruled by Louis D'Ambroise from Château de Valquiétude
	- **Argestes**: the West country, administrated by Arthrus Wadvise.
	- **Notos**: the South country, along the Mitoyan Sea (German-inspired), ruled by Archie Vonschiff.
	- **Apeliotes**: the East country, ruled by Archi Baldwin
	- **Eurus**: the Mercantile Empire of the South-East (italian-inspired), buffering between the Mitoyan Sea and Naval Levan Empire, and presided by Edouardo Volpe
	- **Academy**: an enclave in Eurus, where sorcerers build a place where they would not be hunded by the Ecclesia and could study and teach each other
	- **Factory**: an enclave in Boreas, where major weapons were built during the Heptarmies war
	- **Conclavia**: a retroceded enclave at the center of the continent where the Rampart can meet; it is a non man's land
	- **Congrican**: the enclave where the Ecclesia sits, on top of an hill, underlooking Alfurn
	- **Alfurn**: the abandoned former capitcal of the Alfurian Empire; a de facto enclave as it has risen from the ground to float above a huge chasm and is now the home of the mad dragons and distorted gravity
	- **Sylphoria** (from Zephyr) the home of the Sylphs, the Elven people that hid into the Zephyrus forest
	- **Fir** (from Zephyr): the huge forest where the Sylphs live, as known by humans.

To the North is Valkheim, the realm of the Valks, a tribal society. Their capital is the mist city of Nibelgard.


#### Politics
- **Quincumvira**: alliance of the five human nations (Boreas, Argests, Noyos, Apeliotes, Eurus) and the four enclaves (Academy, Factory, Congrican, Conclavia)
- **Rampart**: Quincumvira + dwarfs (Nibelung) + elves (Sylphs, Alfur) + halfling + gnomes (Hudulfolk: illusionist, Alfaskolinn: creators)

Half a century after the end of the Heptarmies war, the Rampart is crumbling from the inside. In the five nations of the Quincumvira, the monarchs (especially the youngs) dream of an intrusion-free reign. 

In the West, the Sylphs don't approve of the impact an industrial revolution has on Nature. Their worries fall short of the dwarfs' grudge, and the gnome's optimism, however.

As for the Academy, how will she fare with respect to the Factory? Will they be the best allied, thwarting the attemps of the Ecclesia to outlaw progress, be it magical or thecnical, or will they become archenemy? Could there be an opportunity for the Ecclesia to regain its influence?

Will the Factory stands its ground? Boreas wants to get its land back--and what sits on it in the process. All countries would love that as well, but their claims are not as strong. Will it prevail over all the internal struggles and intrigues of the Rampart investors? Contrary to the Academy whose council banded together against the Ecclesia, nothing bonds together the Factory quite like what it builds.

The Rampart stood the onslaught of the Heptarmies, but will it pass the test of time? Royalists, nationalists, imperialists, it gets harder and harder to align a common vision.


### Argestes

#### Geography
- Sturdykeep: capital city
- Aldur: major city (confluence of two rivers)
- Grey mounts: a high peak of the Aegis
- Frostpeaks: a high mountain

#### Geopolitics
Argestes is ruled by Chamberlain Arthrus Wadvise, temporarily regent and pro-rampart. He administrates the country until the prince Eddward Roywall V. Eddward's father has been bedridden since he was 5 and recently died. 

Eddward the fifth, tired of hearing how his father was weak is rebellious against Arthrus, who incarnates the ruling strength. As a consequence, Eddward is leaning away from the chamberlain's view. He is fervent nationalist. Encouraged by Duke Liam Battleworth, he might not wait the legal age to rule.

The court is established at Sturdykeep.

#### Geopolitics: Conclavia
Conclavia is where the leaders of the Rampart meet to discuss the binding treaties. With each passing year, some momentum is lost and creating a common vision becomes harder.

As a city, Conclavia is unique. It is the most modern city, not only built, but planed. Straight streets forming a perfect grid, the horlotram, autonomous night lights, the city is true wonder but its most prestigious feature is the full-fledge areostation (FR: aréogare): a hemisphere of water floating thanks to an array of Graviterias where airship can water-land

#### Geopolitics: Ecclesia

Once the mightiest influence on Septentriona, the Ecclesia now struggles on the political front.

The Ecclesia was created... (Witchunt, cryptolyse and disappearance of magic, Balthazar)

The Ecclesia's power has been decreasing since the restoration of magic and the creation of the Accademy. The arrival of the Factory only made things worse. Both the Academy and Factory are seeking to unravel the inner working of the universe. The Ecclesia thrives upon the mysteries of the Pantheon and is never stronger than when the common folk needs faith.

Common priest, however, usually work the common good.

#### Geopolitics: groups and organizations

##### Neo-imperialist
To counter the rise of the separatist philosophy, emerged the Coalition League. This group tries to coordinate the pro-Ramparts across all Septentriona to lobby in favor of a administrarchy.

Unconviced by the inefficiency of an administrative system, or simply in for more selfish reasons, the neo-imperialists form a secret organization whose goal is to replace the Rampart by a more straightforward approach. Their leader is called Lerne, which is a title, rather than a name. Their symbol is the hydra as it is built so that even if a group of neo-imperialist is captured, the whole will not be impacted and more will join the cause.

Neo-imperialist comprises people from every background:

##### Other
- **Vox Noctis**: an organization operating under cover, polically supporting the Quicumvira. Elite members are called "Vox"




#### (Geo)politics: Etherium
- **Etherium**: mineral with magical energy. While having solidified magical energy is extraordinay, the density of energy is quite low. To be useful, etherium needs to be refined
- **Etheria**: refined etherium
- **Etherune**: etherium in which a magical rune is etched

The availability of cristalized magic energy in etherium makes it a inavualable resoruce (at least in society refusing to sacrificies people). The etherium is precious for the Factory (powering machines) and both the Academy and Ecclesia (source of magic), making it even more valuable, as well as creating balance. For the other parties, it is a way to control those factions, maybe imposing a new empire.



### Calendar
A day correspond to a rotation, defined as the interval between two zeniths. Years are grouped by 8 (an octa). The first year (Octuna) accounts for 402 days. The other for 360. A true revolution is worth ~365.25 days.

All years are divided into 4 seasons.
- Octunal season: a 40-days month, a 20-days month, 40-days month
- Other season: a 40-days month, a 10-days month, a 40-days month
Soltice and equinox fall during the minor months. The two additional days of the octunas are appended to the summer and winter soltices.

Each month is divided into periods of 10 days. The two additional days are part of no month. The year starts in the Vernal (Spring).

#### Months
The months are based on the zodiacal constellation.

- **Behem** (Spring):
	* Hamal
	* Aldebaran
	* Callux
- **Kuj** (Summer):
	* Tarf
	* Regulus
	* Spica
- **Tyf** (Fall):
	* Librae
	* Antares
	* Kaustralis
- **Levia** (Winter):
	* Algedi
	* Dalsud
	* Kullat

New year at the start of spring. Special days:
- Vernal
- Caliendis
- Ventis
- Nox


#### Days of week
Prim, Sec, Trib, Qua, Chinc, Sext, Sep, Oct, Nov, Diè

The day of the months are numbered as `Week-day` with Roman numbers. For instance `IV-VII` is the 7th day of the 4th week. 

### End of the Rampart era
Strange orders, craftsmen disappearing, some turning up dead, something is happening. The neo-imperialists eventually rise and destroy Conclavia thanks to their flying city ship. The main feature of this huge ship is the Eye, a giant etheria crystal wrough in the shape of a diamond. It helps focus the energy of the wizard, sacrificing people to generate a enormous beam of energy.


## Moebium
The gods were mostly losing the titangelic war. When the Demon Bane did not work, they went for Demon Ban instead. Using Orimancy, the folded reality, stranding the demons in the Abyss. In the process, they created Elysium, the plane where the gods built their city: Celestia. They also created the elemental planes.

In reality, the Astral plane, as the Meobium is also known, is a Moebius belt, composed from part of Oekumenia. The Abyss pierce the belt. The Hadal is the part that is outward, thus not visible the from the Elysium. 

A sun rotates around a plane perpendiclar to the belt's major axis. During night, in the inwards part, the illumated remainder of the belt is visible. Outward, only stars can be seen (hence the name "sea of stars").

The stars are runes that maintain the fold together. The elemental planes are on the back of their dragonids. Their mobility is why getting to them is so difficult without a stable portal. The sun is actually the plane of fire.

Edit: actually, the "sun" stays where it is but a wave inverts the Moebium, responsible for the night and day cycle.
